# Backend — Jinshin Brew Reserve Coffee House

## Overview

The **Backend** is the central API server that powers both the Admin Dashboard (`frontend-admin`) and the Customer Storefront (`frontend-coffee`).

Built with **NestJS** and **MongoDB (Mongoose)**, the backend handles all business logic including admin authentication, full product catalog management, customer order processing, file uploads, and dashboard analytics. It exposes a versioned REST API at `/api/v1` and includes a Swagger UI for interactive documentation.

## Architecture Summary

```
Internet
    │
    ▼
Nginx (reverse proxy)
    ├── /api  →  Backend (NestJS — port 3000)
    │
    ├── /admin → frontend-admin (Next.js)
    └── /     → frontend-coffee (Next.js)
```

The backend exposes a single versioned API prefix:

```
Base URL: /api/v1
```

All admin-protected routes use a Bearer token interceptor (`HTTPInterceptor`). Public product and order creation routes are unauthenticated.

## Module Details

### 1. Auth Module

**Path:** `src/modules/auth/`

Handles admin authentication using username/password credentials. On success, generates encrypted node-rsa authorization token.

#### Endpoints

| Method | Route           | Auth Required | Description                     |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/auth/login`   | No            | Authenticate admin, returns node-rsa encrypted token |
| POST   | `/auth/logout`  | Yes (NODE-RSA)     | Invalidate/end admin session    |
| GET    | `/auth/check`   | Yes (NODE-RSA)     | Verify token validity           |

#### Auth Flow

1. Admin submits `username` + `password`
2. Backend finds admin user by username in MongoDB
3. `bcrypt.compare()` validates the password against the stored hash
4. On success, a NODE-RSA encrypted token is generated with payload: `{ subId, username, role: "admin", userAgent }`
5. Token and expiry timestamp returned to client

#### Security Notes

- Passwords are stored as bcrypt hashes (salt rounds: 12)
- A NODE-RSA encrypted token used for all protected routes via `HTTPInterceptor`
- Admin seeding handled by `SeedModule` on first startup

### 2. Products Module
